Here is a simple program that generates a public and private key file, with a key size of 1024 bits. The program imports two scripts one for prime number generation
the next is for performing the two version of the euclidean algorithm for Greatest Common Denominator calculation as well as calculating the modular inverse of two numbers. 
The main script does the encryption and decryption following the RSA protocol. 
I used the book "Cracking Codes with Python" by Al Sweigart to help me as well, I would highly recommend this book. 
Please feel free to use this program for any reason, I did this simply out of wanting to learn more about the fundamentals of cryptography.
